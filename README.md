# Daibaties_prediction
💡 Project Overview:
This repository hosts a Machine Learning project focused on predicting the onset of diabetes in patients. The project utilizes a Neural Network (Deep Learning) model to analyze various diagnostic measurements and classify whether a patient is likely to be diabetes-positive or negative.
The primary goal is to provide a predictive tool based on health data, demonstrating the application of deep learning techniques in binary classification tasks for healthcare.
✨ Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning, scaling, and preparing the raw data for model training
Neural Network Model: Implementation and training of a dense feed-forward neural network for classification.
Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using key metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Jupyter Notebook: Complete, step-by-step documentation of the entire ML workflow, from data loading to final prediction.
🛠️ Tech StackThis project is implemented entirely in Python and relies on the following Key libraries:
Language : Python 
Data Handling : pandas, numpyData for  manipulation and numerical operations 
Machine Learning : scikit-learn fot data splitting, preprocessing (e.g., scaling), and metrics
Deep Learning: TensorFlow or Keras for building and training the Neural Network
Model Visualization : matplotlib, seaborn for plotting results and data distributions.
